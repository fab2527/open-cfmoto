/**
 * Supported bike dashboards. Each model drives the whole video geometry:
 *
 *  - [bikeWidth]x[bikeHeight]: the panel's native resolution — what the bike-side encoder
 *    produces and what the dash decoder expects.
 *  - [aaWidth]x[aaHeight]: the Android Auto codec resolution we negotiate. AA only streams
 *    fixed sizes (see ServiceDiscoveryResponse.codecResolutionFor), so pick the smallest one
 *    that fully contains the panel; the leftover is declared as margins and the phone renders
 *    the UI into a centered bikeWidth x bikeHeight viewport that SurfaceCropper extracts 1:1.
 *  - [densityDpi]: DPI reported to the phone — tunes how large the AA UI draws on this panel.
 *
 * Portrait panels are supported the same way — use a portrait AA resolution (e.g. 720x1280).
 *
 * To add a model, ask the user for the [BIKE-REPORT] log line (EasyConnProber logs it when the
 * bike sends REQ_RV_CONFIG_CAPTURE): it contains the panel resolution and the head-unit name.
